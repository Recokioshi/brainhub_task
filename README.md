# BRAINHUB TASK - Adrian Gaik

## description

Projet is created as a recruitment task.
All code is written in TypeScript.
I hope it covers all the requirements.

### server

I used Express.js with MongoDB to handle requests from the client.

### client

- Created with create-react-app.
- Using Redux was mentioned in the task description. This project is fairly simple so Redux doesn't have much work to do here, but I hope I found quite logic use for it.
- As you stated, UI is not important in this task I decided to choose my implementation using SASS.
- You mentioned in the task description that tests are important to you. Apart of the tests alone I used Typescritp which I think is less error prone and helps to avoid many mistakes yet in the development process.

## installation

- As this project contains client and server side so please run install in the root folder and in the /client folder.
- Before you run the server please fill the DB address in the .env file with the DATABASE_URL variable, or directly in the server.ts file.
- All tests can be run with "client:test" and "server:test" scripts.
  You can run the whole app with "dev" script.
